== Icon Haiku

In 2012, Iconoclast Labs entered the Rails Rumble and created IconHaiku.com
For the most part this project was fun, and done.  But we're sharing the source on here, and welcome any creative
fixes and or additions.


Details of the 48 hour adventure can be found here[http://iconoclastlabs.com/cms/blog/posts/icon-haiku-rails-rumble-2012]
